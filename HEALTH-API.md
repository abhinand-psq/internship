## Status Codes

| Code | Meaning | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| 200  | OK | API is healthy and database is connected |
| 503  | Service Unavailable | API is running but database connection failed |

## Troubleshooting

### Database Connection Issues
If you see "unhealthy" status:
1. Check if PostgreSQL is running
2. Verify database credentials in `.env`
3. Ensure the `usercreation` database exists
4. Check network connectivity

### Application Not Starting
1. Verify all dependencies are installed (`npm install`)
2. Check if port 3000 is available
3. Review error logs for specific issues
